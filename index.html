	<h3> My Previous Projects </h3>
	<p> My first big project was a program that enables a user to calculate the simple/compound interest on an investment or the amount that will need to be repaid on a home loan. This 		project was done in Python. </p>

	<br>
	<p> My second big project entailed a basic program that enables a person or business to manage tasks that are assigned to the members of their team. Essentially it is a task 		manager program. This program was coded in Python. </p>

	<br>
	<p> My third project was a project management system. This program enables one to keep track of projects and the people involved in these projects. In the Project java class various 		data is stored. This includes the project number, project name, project type, the physical address of the project, the project's cost, the amount that has been paid to date for the 		project and the due date of the project. The Person java class also stores data. This includes the person's title, their name, their telephone number, their email address and their 		physical address. The main class asks various questions and stores the data in text files.</p>
